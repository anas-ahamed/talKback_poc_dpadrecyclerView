### 1.0.0-alpha04

2023-02-13

#### New Features

- Added `DpadLinearSpacingItemDecoration` and `DpadGridSpacingItemDecoration` to easily set spacing between items
- Added `setScrollEnabled` to enable or disable scroll events
- Added `setLayoutEnabled` to enable or disable the layout of children
- Added support for reverse layout via `setReverseLayout`
- Restored support for basic touch event scrolling without triggering selection or alignment changes
- Added support for item prefetching for nested RecyclerViews
- `setSmoothScrollMaxPendingAlignments` allows limiting the number of scroll changes still not applied
- `setSmoothScrollMaxPendingMoves` allows remembering DPAD events not yet applied
- Improved fast smooth scrolling in grids with different span sizes
- Added `setOnChildLaidOutListener` to observe when each view is laid out

#### API Changes

- `ViewHolderAlignment` was renamed  to `SubPositionAlignment`. Now `DpadViewHolder` returns these alignments in `getSubPositionAlignments`.

#### Bug fixes

- Fixed `DpadRecyclerView` not searching for focus if it's currently retaining focus due to a pivot removal. This prevented accumulating pending moves during smooth scrolling.
- A nested `DpadRecyclerView` now won't search for focus if its parent `RecyclerView` is still smooth scrolling ([#50](https://github.com/rubensousa/DpadRecyclerView/issues/50))
- Alignment not being restored correctly for small lists ([#71](https://github.com/rubensousa/DpadRecyclerView/issues/71))
- Unnecessary `ItemAnimator` animations were running when scrolling during item changes ([#47](https://github.com/rubensousa/DpadRecyclerView/issues/47))
- a11y scroll actions were not triggering scroll events ([#66](https://github.com/rubensousa/DpadRecyclerView/issues/66))
- Circular focus not working correctly for the first row ([#37](https://github.com/rubensousa/DpadRecyclerView/issues/37))

#### Testing

- `DisableIdleTimeoutRule` will now wait for idle input after the test is over to avoid dispatching key events to other tests
