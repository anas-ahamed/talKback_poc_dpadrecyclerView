/**
 * A ViewHolder that will render a [Composable] in [Content].
 *
 * Focus is kept inside the internal [ComposeView] to ensure that it behaves correctly
 * and to workaround the following issues:
 *
 * 1. Focus is not sent correctly from Views to Composables:
 * [b/268248352](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/268248352)
 * This is solved by just holding the focus in [ComposeView]
 *
 * 2. Clicking on a focused Composable does not trigger the standard audio feedback:
 * [b/268268856](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/268268856)
 * This is solved by just handling the click on [ComposeView] directly
 *
 * Check the default implementation at [DpadComposeViewHolder]
